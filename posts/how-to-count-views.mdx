Counting the number of hits on a page seems like an easy enough task, but it requires a single source of truth that can be updated and retrieved from at any given moment. This is a challenge that calls for some sort of organized persistant storage service. This kind of service is also known as a <Sparkles rainbow><Spicy>database.</Spicy></Sparkles>

<Info>
    There are 2 main types of databases that are commonly used in the industry:
    
    1. **Relational (or SQL)** Databases
    2. **NoSQL** Databases

    [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a NoSQL, Document Database solution has a great article explaining the differences between these two [here](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained/nosql-vs-sql).
</Info>

For the purpose of this website/blog, I chose to use a **SQL Database**, and more specifically [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) (a flavour of SQL) for a number of reasons.

- This database application is very simple, we're only storing the number of views/hits for every blog post on the website. This means the database paradigm that we choose isn't that important.
- I'm already a bit familiar with the SQL paradigm.
- I needed a database service that's easy to work with and connect to without being a local file.
    
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), the front-end hosting platform that I use doesn't support file system persistant storage because it is a serverless service. This means SQLite isn't adequete.


# The Assumed Tools

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (My front-end framework of choice)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (A React full-stack framework that I use for my blog)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Chosen flavour of SQL)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) (A modern JavaScript ORM (object relational mapper) which makes working with databases in JS, and especially TypeScript, painless)

# <Spicy>1. </Spicy> The Setup

Every database needs some sort of blueprint that describes how the data organization. This is called the <Spicy>schema.</Spicy> 

```js
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Post {
  slug       String   @id
  created_at DateTime @default(now())
  views      Int      @default(0)
}
```
