Counting the number of hits on a page seems like an easy enough task, but it requires a single source of truth that can be updated and retrieved from at any given moment. This is a challenge that calls for some sort of organized persistant storage service. This kind of service is also known as a <Spicy>Database</Spicy>.

<Info>
    There are 2 main types of databases that are commonly used in the industry:
    
    1. **Relational (or SQL)** Databases
    2. **NoSQL** Databases

    [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a NoSQL, Document Database solution has a great article explaining the differences between these two [here](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained/nosql-vs-sql).
</Info>

For the purpose of this website/blog, I chose to use a **SQL Database**, and more specifically PostgreSQL (a flavour of SQL) for a number of reasons.

- This database application is very simple, we're only storing the number of views/hits for every blog post on the website. This means the database paradigm that we choose isn't that important.
- I'm already a bit familiar with the SQL paradigm.
- I needed a database service that's easy to work with and connect to without being a local file.
    - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), the front-end hosting platform that I use doesn't support file system persistant storage because it is a serverless service.

Before we start making some other tech stack (make a tool tip component definition here) choices, let's go through some assumptions.
